# gpx_to_csv_conversion_java
A GPX file contains GPS data such as waypoints, routes, and tracks. For this project, we extract latitude and longitude data points from a provided GPX file (triplog.gpx), which was recorded during a trip. The program will process this data to create a CSV file (triplog.csv) containing time, latitude, and longitude in a structured format.
